## Write to Blob Storage

This demo is based on the Microsoft Ignite | The Tour demo for the [DEV50 - Serverless Module](https://github.com/Microsoft/IgniteTheTour/tree/master/DEV%20-%20Building%20your%20Applications%20for%20the%20Cloud/DEV50).

1. Start with an initialized database
2. Open Storage Explorer and show the existing SKUs
3. Use the CLI to add a sample SKU:
    `dotnet run add 2085`
1. Run the command to add the image:
    `dotnet run set-image 2085 2085.jpg`
1. Show the updated image in Storage Explorer
2. Navigate to show the image
3. Review the related code
    1. [Access the image and pass the stream](https://github.com/Microsoft/IgniteTheTour/blob/master/DEV%20-%20Building%20your%20Applications%20for%20the%20Cloud/DEV50/src/TailwindTraderServerless/CLI/Image.cs)
    1. [Create container](https://github.com/Microsoft/IgniteTheTour/blob/master/DEV%20-%20Building%20your%20Applications%20for%20the%20Cloud/DEV50/src/TailwindTraderServerless/DataAccess/StorageAccess.cs#L41-L52)
    1. [Upload the image](https://github.com/Microsoft/IgniteTheTour/blob/master/DEV%20-%20Building%20your%20Applications%20for%20the%20Cloud/DEV50/src/TailwindTraderServerless/DataAccess/StorageAccess.cs#L94-L108)

## NoSQL Demo

The NoSQL demo is split into two parts.

### Flights database

The instructions to set up the flights database are in [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/anthonychu/cosmosdb-gremlin-flights).

1. Show the [running demo](https://cosmosdb-flights.azurewebsites.net/). SEA-YVR has few routes, SEA-ATL has many.
2. Show steps to create an Azure Cosmos DB instance in the portal
3. Show the graph in data explorer
4. Show the backing JSON
5. [Walk through the code](https://github.com/anthonychu/cosmosdb-gremlin-flights/blob/master/CosmosDBGremlinFlights.Web/Controllers/HomeController.cs)

### Link shortener

1. Shorten a link
2. Show the associated table storage
3. [Code to insert the link](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/jlik.me/blob/master/jlikme.corefn/FunctionHost.cs#L98-L212)
4. [Code for the redirect](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/jlik.me/blob/master/jlikme.corefn/FunctionHost.cs#L214-L277)
5. [Code to insert mettadata](https://github.com/JeremyLikness/jlik.me/blob/master/jlikme.corefn/FunctionHost.cs#L285-L384)
6. Navigate to document database
7. Query initial documents and show format
8. Sort by `_ts` descending and show newer documents
9. Open the Power BI dashboard and show data "deep dive"

## Azure SQL

The demo for SQL is based on the [DEV10: Designing Resilient Cloud Applications](https://github.com/Microsoft/IgniteTheTour/tree/master/DEV%20-%20Building%20your%20Applications%20for%20the%20Cloud/DEV10) repository.

1. Show the Azure SQL account and the available features
2. Drill into SQL databases then `tailwind`
3. Show geo-replication
4. Show query editor
5. Execute `select top 5 * from dbo.Inventory`
6. Show [InventoryManager](https://github.com/Microsoft/IgniteTheTour/blob/master/DEV%20-%20Building%20your%20Applications%20for%20the%20Cloud/DEV10/src/inventory-service/InventoryService.Api/Services/InventoryManager.cs)
7. Show [SqlInventoryData](https://github.com/Microsoft/IgniteTheTour/blob/master/DEV%20-%20Building%20your%20Applications%20for%20the%20Cloud/DEV10/src/inventory-service/InventoryService.Api/Services/SqlInventoryData.cs)

## Database Migration Services
